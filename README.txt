How to install:
=========================

If you're reading this, CONGRADULATIONS, you have cloned a git repo WOOT!

All you have to do is source the 'umw_maintenance.sql' file

PLEASE NOTE:

there is a file by the same name that has a '_test' suffix and you should leave that alone OR ELSE SUFFER DEATH!!!

or just have a screwed up project!

Thank you for trying the UMW Maintenance Database Demo!!!!
